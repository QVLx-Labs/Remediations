Some info on the remediations in this repository:

1. They work. All detectors and remediations delivered by QVLx are proven to work. These are NOT vibe-coded theoreticals. These are crafted to solve the problem they address.
2. They are safe to run. The scripts will mention whether or not they modify the system on which they run. And even for those systems the changes are resonsible changes.
3. These scripts are free and can be used without obligation. Enjoy.
